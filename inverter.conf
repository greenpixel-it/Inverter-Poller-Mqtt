# Basic configuration options for the actual inverter polling process...

# The device to read from...
# Use: /dev/ttyS0 if you have a serial device,
#      /dev/ttyUSB0 if a USB<>Serial,
#      /dev/hidraw0 if you're connecting via the USB port on the inverter.

device=/dev/pts/1

# How many times per hour is the program going to run...
# This is used to calculate the PV & Load Watt Hours between runs...
# If unsure, leave as default - it will run every minute...

# (120 = every 30 seconds)...
run_interval=120

# This allows you to modify the amperage in case the inverter is giving an incorrect
# reading compared to measurement tools.  Normally this will remain '1'
amperage_factor=1.0

# This allos you to modify the wattage in case the inverter is giving an incorrect
# reading compared to measurement tools.  Normally this will remain '1'
watt_factor=1.01

# Depending on the protocol version used and your device,
# you might need to change the following parameters

#### For Axpert VM3 inverter like, use those values ###
# This allows you to modify the buffersize for the qpiri command
qpiri=98

# This allows you to modify the buffersize for the qpiws command
qpiws=36

# This allows you to modify the buffersize for the qmod command
qmod=5

# This allows you to modify the buffersize for the qpigs command
qpigs=110
